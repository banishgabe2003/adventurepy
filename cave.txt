A more "middle of the road" path seemed perfect for you right now, so you set course east towards the grand Archenland cave system.
You enjoy a rather peaceful trek in an unfamiliar area, surrounded by mossy cliffs, calming rivers, and vast hillsides; all
complimented by a cool breeze and clear skies. You even come across a few travelling adventurers and merchants alike on your way.
One of these adventurers advises you on a path he charted himself in the cave that leads to untrecked passages, though he had to leave
before he could explore more due to a lack of food supplies: Left, right, right, left, left, right. This kind advice fills you
with a bit more confidence in exploring than before, lightening your mood quite a bit; along with your senses. 
You finally come across the known entrance to the cave system, hidden behind a grand waterfall.

You hop across wet stones and rocks through the river until you reach a small cliffside that wraps behind the waterfall; you take
a moment to brace for the intense rush of cold water and pressure, and run through until you pop out into the suddenly very quiet
cave, dripping wet. You sit for a few to dry off, studying your torn map of the cave system and traversed paths. Eventually, you
gather your belongings, put out your fire, and head deep down into the labyrinth. 
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
You repeat this phrase over and over again in your head. It's the path the adventurer you met earlier told you about. You'll
have to find untrecked passages, as the other passages would've already been picked clean by previous spelunkers. A small pebble
falling catches you off-guard, and you swing your torch around to find nothing.
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
Don't go the wrong way; it's simple.
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
Wait, you went right last time, ...right?
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
Left, right, right, left, left, right.
...
You have no idea where you are anymore.
You sigh and slam your weapon on the ground in lost frustration, only for the ground to suddenly crack under you. You stop and stare
in confusion and curiosity for a moment before realizing you probably should move. Too late.
In an instant, the ground collapses under you, sending you spiraling underground until you land in an ice cold pool of water and darkness.
You flail in the water for a bit before finally surfacing and trying to gather your surroundings. You swim to the closest patch of ground,
and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness. The cavern you fell into is one massive, round room. And in the center of it lies your worst
nightmare: a hulking troll, with a wooden bat in hand that out-sizes you 3 times at least, sitting on a pile of plundered gold and equipment
from previously lost spelunkers.

Slowly, he stands up, and lets out a bellowing roar before charging you.

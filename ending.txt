After hard-fought battles and long-trekked journies, you barely bother to check your supplies before rushing home as fast as you can,
now that you have enough gold to cover the medical costs. You think about seeing your mother smile for the first time in weeks as you
run over hillsides and rivers alike, getting closer to home.

As you run over the last hill before the view of your village comes into view, your heart drops in shock at the sight before you.
The familiar, comforting sight of your hometown, known for its slow and peaceful lifestyle, currently lay in flame, clouding the
overhead sky in smoke and an orange hue. Screams echo from the homes, voices familiar to you; friends you grew up with.
You force your frozen body to move towards the chaos, with shadows of various monsters terrorizing the village growing larger.
You rush into the village, and are once again frozen with fear for a moment. Flames surround you, as do bodies of familiar friends
and villagers. However, your journies and experience steels you with courage, and you aim your weapon to the enemies around you
as you attempt to save what can be saved. One by one, monsters of various races in the invading party are struck down by you, and you
manage to save several villagers. As the chaos settles, another shriek sends a chill down your spine, coming from the south side of 
the village: your home. You race with desperation to your home, and your heart beats even faster as you find it in flames and the
roof caving in. You bust through the rubble and find your brother, burnt in various areas and hurt, holding a dagger towards a hulking
Minotaur as he stares down your little brother and ailing mother in bed. You shout in anger towards the beast, who turns with a wicked
smile, and hold your weapon true; you cannot give up after all of this. You must protect your family.

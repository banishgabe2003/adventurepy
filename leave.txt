With one last hug, you wish your brother goodbye as you take a look at your mother in bed, balling a fist in determination
as you step out into Narniuh for the first time ever. The fresh air hits your face, you wave goodbye to fellow villagers who wish
you luck on your journey. With this, you head to the north exit that leads to the crossroads, leaving you three destinations to visit.

To the north, lies the royal Kingdom of Archenland. It is a great first destination for adventurers.
Perhaps you could inquire about job postings there, or involve yourself in the rumored thieving scene. To the west awaits 
the arid, highly dangerous Bonchavi desert; known for it's ruins of an ancient, wealthy civilization that was wiped out by the hostile 
wildlife inhabiting the area. To the east, the grand Narniuh cave system holds seemingly infinite explorability with spelunkers 
still mapping out its endless paths even today, though rumors of a troll taking up lodging has halted that.
Maybe just one of these areas will provide the gold you need, or perhaps you may need to journey all around. Nonetheless, 
you need to pick a starting destination.

In a journey fueled by determination and a strong will, you set course for the treachorous
Bonchavi desert to the west, acknowledging the dangers and the treasure that comes along with it.
The aggresively humid air hits you like a wall as you enter the territory, and you're forced
to cover your mouth and nose with a cloth due to all the sand in the air. The sky is a deep orange hue,
and the sun beats down as if it solely had it out for you. For miles, you only come across mounds of sand,
skeletons, and small patches of rubble from a long lost civilization. The occasional harpy soars
overhead, but seem to be too bothered by the heat to swoop down and attack.

Eventually, you spot a singular tower in the distance, hazy in the heat, half buried in sand on an angle.

It seems rather unplundered, and you make way towards it in hopes of some hidden treasure, or
shelter from the heat at the very least. As you enter the large cobblestone tower, the wind
echoes through the cracks and holes of the tower, leaving an eerie atmosphere as you brush away
hills of sand and explore empty rooms. Eventually, after managing some stumbling and climbing up
crumbled stairs, you reach a large central chamber with a fair layer of sand and a mound of gold
at the end of it. You excitedly rush towards it before realizing you made a mistake, and it's too
late: the ground shakes and throws you off your feet, face-first into the sand. The tower itself shakes
and dust quickly fills the air. As you manage to get yourself up, a large figure suddenly shoots up
from the ground and lets out a wretched cry; you recognize it as an ancient sandworm, a fiersome enemy
only rumored to exist here. Nervously, you recognize only two possible options: Submit and die, or fight.
And that's way too much gold in front of you to submit. You calm your shakes, and aim your weapon high.

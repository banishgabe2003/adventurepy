"N-no, thank you. I'll, uh, go elsewhere." You say as you quickly turn your back on a fight you definitely can't win,
and leave the tavern as you hear the hardy patrons laugh as the man mocks you, though you keep your course.

The embarrasment you just experienced causes you to walk the alleys in a bit of a distracted daze as you stare at the worn
cobblestone streets, wondering if this journey was a stupid idea. Suddenly, caught off-guard, you feel a sharp point at your back,
and a whisper: "Oi, lad. Easy, now. Just gimme all you got, and I'll be on my way".

You shake in fear at this sudden robbery, though you know deep down you cannot falter now. Your mother needs this money;
no crook is going to take that from you. With unexpected speed, you spin around and knock the thief on his knees, before he
shouts in anger and brings himself back up, aiming his knife at you, ready to fight!
